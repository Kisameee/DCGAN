# DCGAN
implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network with Keras.
The approach flows from this [**paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).


The same model was trained several times with the same configuration 

batch size = 256
nb epoch = 25 

i just changed the optimizers and tested many ones.
The optimizer's parameters taken directly from [Keras source](https://keras.io/optimizers/)
